Our program simulates a restaurant ordering machine. 
The user can be a manager or a customer. 
The options/interface they are exposed to will be different based on which they chose.
As the customer, the user can order food and drinks, change the type/characteristics of different foods, 
    such as the ingredients, size etc...
As the manager, the user can change/add food and drinks. 
There's a login system to distinguish between different users. 
A list of ingredients/types of foods/login ID will be kept in text files and saved for future uses.
